## Activity Instructions

1. **Word Length Identification**
   - Select ten words that you feel best represent the story.
   - Record the number of letters in each word.
   - Format: Word | Number of Letters
   
. . .

Example 1: Hi | 2

. . .

Example 2: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious | 34 

. . .

You get the idea!


2. **Calculate the Average**
   - Compute the average length of the ten words you selected. Round to two decimal places.
   - Include notation and units if applicable.`
  
3. **Read me your results**

## (8 am Recitation Average)
. . .


```{r}
## Input the class averages
class.averages <- c(5.1, 6.6, 5.3, 7.2, 6, 6, 6, 5.2, 6, 5.8, 6)

## Display the average of all the class average word lengths
cat("Population Mean (Class Average):",mean(class.averages))
cat("True Mean:", 4.25)
cat("Population Standard Deviation:", sd(class.averages))
cat("Median:",median(class.averages))
cat("Min:", min(class.averages))
cat("Max:", max(class.averages))


## Make plots side-by-side
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

## Boxplot
boxplot(class.averages, horizontal = TRUE,
        col = "darkolivegreen3",
        xlab = "Word Length",
        main = "Boxplot of Word Length",
        pch = 19,
        ylim = c(1.5, 9.5))
axis(1, at = seq(2, 9, by = 1))
abline(v = 4.25, lty = 2)

## Histogram
hist(class.averages,
     col = "khaki2",
     xlim = c(1.5, 9.5),
     las = 1,
     ylab = " ",
     xlab = "Word Length",
     main = "Distribution of Word Length",
     breaks = 10) # Ensuring consistent breaks in the histogram
axis(1, at = seq(2, 9, by = 1))
abline(v = 4.25, lty = 2)

## Return plots to be one plot at a time
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

```
