## Goal

Find the **change in the difference of mean depression scores** between education categories (iii) and (i) for a one-unit increase in age.


### Write the Regression Equation

$$
\text{Depression Score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_2 \text{Edu}_{ii} + \beta_3 \text{Edu}_{iii} + \beta_4 (\text{Age} \cdot \text{Edu}_{ii}) + \beta_5 (\text{Age} \cdot \text{Edu}_{iii}) + \epsilon
$$

1. **$\beta_0:$** The mean depression score for individuals with a college degree (category (i)) at age 0.  
2. **$\beta_1:$** The change in depression score per year of age for individuals with a college degree (category (i)).  
3. **$\beta_2:$** The difference in mean depression scores between individuals with some college (category (ii)) and those with a college degree (category (i)) at age 0.  
4. **$\beta_3:$** The difference in mean depression scores between individuals with only a high school degree (category (iii)) and those with a college degree (category (i)) at age 0.  
5. **$\beta_4:$** The difference in the effect of age (slope) between individuals with some college (category (ii)) and those with a college degree (category (i)).  
6. **$\beta_5:$** The difference in the effect of age (slope) between individuals with only a high school degree (category (iii)) and those with a college degree (category (i)).  
7. **$\epsilon:$** The residual error, representing the variability in depression scores not explained by the model.




### Plug in the Values for Categories (i) and (iii)

1. **Category (i):** This is the baseline, so $\text{Edu}_{ii} = 0$ and $\text{Edu}_{iii} = 0$.  
   The equation for the mean depression score becomes:  
   $$
   \text{Depression Score for (i)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age}
   $$

2. **Category (iii):** Here, $\text{Edu}_{iii} = 1$ and $\text{Edu}_{ii} = 0$.  
   The equation for the mean depression score becomes:  
   $$
   \text{Depression Score for (iii)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_3 + \beta_5 \text{Age}
   $$



### Find the Difference Between Categories (iii) and (i)
Subtract the depression score equation for category (i) from that for category (iii):  
$$
\text{Difference} = (\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age} + \beta_3 + \beta_5 \text{Age}) - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Age})
$$

Simplify:  
$$
\text{Difference} = \beta_3 + \beta_5 \text{Age}
$$

Thus, the difference in mean depression scores between categories (iii) and (i) is:  
$$
\text{Difference} = \beta_3 + \beta_5 \text{Age}
$$



### Find the Change in Difference with Respect to Age
The "Change in Difference" is how this difference changes with one unit increase in age. To calculate this, take the derivative of the difference with respect to age:  
$$
\frac{d}{d\text{Age}} (\beta_3 + \beta_5 \text{Age}) = ...
$$
