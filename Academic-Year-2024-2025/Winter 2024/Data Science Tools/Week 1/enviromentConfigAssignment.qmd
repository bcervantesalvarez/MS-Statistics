# Project Overview

This project looks at birth rates in different U.S. states using data from a public dataset on BigQuery. The goal is to gather, clean, and visualize data about the number of births in each state to understand trends across the country.

## Extracting the Data
The birth records from 1969 to 2008 were collected using Google BigQuery, a tool that lets you work with large datasets. The dataset, called bigquery-public-data.samples.natality, was accessed using Python and the google-cloud-bigquery library.

## Cleaning the Data
Some parts of the data were incomplete. For example, a few entries were missing state names or birth counts. These incomplete entries were removed so that the final data would be accurate for creating charts.

## Exploring the Data
The cleaned data was grouped by state to count the total number of births for each one. A bar chart was used to show the birth counts by state. This helped identify patterns, such as which states had higher or lower birth numbers.

## Modeling the Data
No advanced math or predictive tools were used. The project focused on organizing and visualizing the data. The bar chart acts as a simple way to model the information by showing the birth distribution across states.

## Conclusion
The bar chart shows the total number of births for each state, with states listed from highest to lowest birth counts. States with tall bars had more births, while those with shorter bars had fewer. This chart helps us see differences in birth rates between states and think about what might be causing them, like population size or economic factors.
