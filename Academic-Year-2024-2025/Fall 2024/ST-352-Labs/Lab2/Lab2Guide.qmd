# Data Collection

For Lab Assignment 2, I collected data from two grocery stores: **Walmart** and **Fred Meyer**. The goal is to compare the prices of 15 identical items between the two stores to determine if there is a significant difference in average prices. Below are the data I compared:

| Product                                   | WalmartPrice | FredMeyerPrice |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Coca-Cola 24pk                            | $12.98        | $14.99           |
| Scrub Daddy 1pk                           | $3.88         | $4.99            |
| First Response Pregnancy Test 2pk         | $8.98         | $11.99           |
| Oreo Family Pack 18.12oz                  | $4.88         | $4.99            |
| Stella Rosa Black 750ml                   | $10.98        | $12.99           |
| Tillamook Medium Cheddar Block 32oz       | $12.48        | $13.99           |
| Samsung 65" Crystal HDR 4K TV             | $468.00       | $499.00          |
| Enfamil NeuroPro Baby Formula 27.4oz      | $52.00        | $54.99           |

| Coleman Cooler 52qt                       | $49.99        | $39.99           |
| Corona Heavy-Duty Weeding Hoe             | $62.57        | $77.51           |

Once you have your data, decide whether a two-sample t-test or paired t-test is appropriate based on how you collected your data. For my comparison, I will use a **paired t-test** since the products are identical at both stores.

# Lab Assignment Walk-Thru

## 1. Hypothesis Test

**Hint**:  
We are using a paired t-test since the products are identical across both stores. Use this test to check whether there is a significant difference in average prices.

```{webr-r}
library(readr)
# Import the dataset from the CSV file
products <- read_csv("Academic-Year-2024-2025/Fall 2024/ST-352-Labs/Lab2/storePrices.csv")

names(products)

# Convert price columns to numeric
products$WalmartPrice <- as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", as.character(products$WalmartPrice)))
products$FredMeyerPrice <- as.numeric(gsub("\\$", "", as.character(products$FredMeyerPrice)))

# Display the dataset
head(products)

```

## 2. Hypotheses

The hypotheses for the paired t-test:

- $H_0: \mu_{\text{diff}} = 0$ (No difference in average prices between Walmart and Fred Meyer)
- $H_1: \mu_{\text{diff}} \neq 0$ (There is a difference in average prices between Walmart and Fred Meyer)

```{webr-r}
# Calculate the price differences between Walmart and Fred Meyer
products$Difference <- products$WalmartPrice - products$FredMeyerPrice
products$Difference
```

## 3. Appropriateness of t-Methods

Check if the price differences follow a roughly normal distribution by plotting a histogram:

```{webr-r}
# Plot a histogram of the price differences
# Plot histogram
hist(products$Difference, main = "Histogram of Price Differences",
     xlab = "Price Difference (Walmart - Fred Meyer)")
```

## 4. T-Statistic and P-Value

Perform the paired t-test to get the t-statistic and p-value.

```{webr-r}
# Perform paired t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(products$WalmartPrice, products$FredMeyerPrice, paired = TRUE)

# Output t-statistic, p-value, and degrees of freedom
t_test_result$statistic   # T-statistic
t_test_result$p.value     # P-value
t_test_result$parameter   # Degrees of freedom
```

## 5. Conclusion

Based on the p-value, we will determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.

```{webr-r}
# Conclusion
if(t_test_result$p.value < 0.05) {
  conclusion <- "Reject the null hypothesis: There is a significant difference in prices."
} else {
  conclusion <- "Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference in prices."
}
conclusion
```

## 6. Confidence Interval

Compute the 95% confidence interval for the mean price difference.

```{webr-r}
# Confidence interval
t_test_result$conf.int
```

## 7. Store Preference

Based on the mean price difference, decide which store is cheaper overall.

```{webr-r}
# Store preference
if(mean(t_test_result$conf.int) > 0) {
  store_preference <- "Fred Meyer is generally cheaper"
} else {
  store_preference <- "Walmart is generally cheaper"
}
store_preference
```
