# Objective

In this lab, you'll explore interaction terms in regression models and apply model selection using the `brainhead` dataset. You'll examine gender-based differences, test the significance of interaction terms, and assess multiple regression conditions through transformations.

## Part I: Interaction Term and Gender Differences (12 points)

### Problem 1: Scatterplot with Regression Lines by Gender (2 points)

Create a scatterplot that includes:

- Different symbols for males and females
- Separate regression lines for each gender
- A legend explaining each symbol and line

#### Steps
1. Use `plot()` and `points()` to create scatterplots for males and females.
2. Use `abline()` to add regression lines for each gender.

#### Code Example

```{webr-r}
# Read brainhead data
brainheadData <- read.table("brainhead.txt", header = TRUE)

# Separate data by gender
maleData <- subset(brainheadData, gender == "male")
femaleData <- subset(brainheadData, gender == "female")

# Plot
plot(maleData$headsize, maleData$brainwt,
     pch = 19, col = "blue",
     xlab = "Head Size (cm³)", 
     ylab = "Brain Weight (g)", 
     main = "Brain Weight vs. Head Size by Gender")
points(femaleData$headsize, femaleData$brainwt, pch = 17, col = "red")

# Fit separate regression lines
maleModel <- lm(brainwt ~ headsize, data = maleData)
femaleModel <- lm(brainwt ~ headsize, data = femaleData)

abline(maleModel, col = "blue", lty = 1)
abline(femaleModel, col = "red", lty = 2)
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Male", "Female"), 
       pch = c(19, 17),
       col = c("blue", "red"))
```

### Problem 2: Need for an Interaction Term? (2 points)

Using the scatterplot, discuss if an interaction term is necessary. 

- **Guiding Questions**: Are the regression lines parallel, or do they have different slopes? If they’re similar, an interaction term may not add much value.

### Problem 3: Hypothesis Test for Interaction Term (4 points)

Perform a hypothesis test to evaluate the significance of the interaction term between `headsize` and `gender`.

- **a.** State null and alternative hypotheses.

  - **Guiding Questions**: What does it mean for the interaction term to be significant? Does `headsize` affect `brainwt` differently for each gender?
  
- **b.** Report t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-value.
  
#### Code Example

```{webr-r}
# Fit model with interaction
interactionModel <- lm(brainwt ~ headsize * gender, data = brainheadData)
summary(interactionModel)
```

- **c.** Draw a conclusion based on the p-value.  

  - **Prompt**: Is the p-value for the interaction term low enough (e.g., below 0.05) to suggest that head size’s effect on brain weight differs by gender?

### Problem 4: Least-Squares Regression Equation (2 points)

Write the regression equation, including the interaction term.  

- **Guiding Questions**: How do we interpret each term? What do `headsize` and `gender` contribute to the equation?

### Problem 5: Coefficient Interpretation (2 points)

Interpret the coefficient of the interaction term in the context of gender differences in brain weight.  

- **Guiding Questions**: Does the interaction term suggest that head size’s impact on brain weight changes depending on gender? How much?

## Part II: Multiple Linear Regression Conditions Using the `fish.txt` Dataset (12 points)

### Problem 6: Correlation and Scatterplot Matrix (3 points)

Construct a scatterplot matrix and correlation matrix for the variables in `fish.txt`:
- `catch`: Seasonal bass catch (thousands)
- `residences`: Number of lakeshore residences per square mile
- `size`: Lake size (square miles)
- `structure`: Structure index (measure of lakebed structure)

#### Code Example

```{webr-r}
# Load fish data
fishData <- read.table("fish.txt", header = TRUE)

# Scatterplot matrix
pairs(fishData[, c("catch", "residences", "size", "structure")])

# Correlation matrix
cor(fishData[, c("catch", "residences", "size", "structure")])
```

- **Guiding Questions**: Are there any variables with high correlations? If so, which pairs? Could these correlations suggest multicollinearity in a regression model?

### Problem 7: Model Comparison (3 points)

Compare different models using transformations of `catch`, `residences`, `size`, and `structure` to determine which model best satisfies linearity, constant variance, and normality conditions. Create four models to compare:

1. Original scale
2. Log-transformed response variable (`catch`)
3. Log-transformed predictor variables (`residences`, `size`, `structure`)
4. Log-transformation of all variables (except `access`)

#### Code Example

```{webr-r}
# Log transformations
fishData$logCatch <- log(fishData$catch)
fishData$logResidences <- log(fishData$residences)
fishData$logSize <- log(fishData$size)
fishData$logStructure <- log(fishData$structure)

# Models
originalModel <- lm(catch ~ residences + size + structure + access, data = fishData)
logCatchModel <- lm(logCatch ~ residences + size + structure + access, data = fishData)
logPredictorsModel <- lm(catch ~ logResidences + logSize + logStructure + access, data = fishData)
logAllModel <- lm(logCatch ~ logResidences + logSize + logStructure + access, data = fishData)

# Summaries for comparison
summary(originalModel)
summary(logCatchModel)
summary(logPredictorsModel)
summary(logAllModel)
```

- **Guiding Questions**: Compare the residual plots, constant variance, and normality of each model’s residuals. Which model best meets these assumptions? Explain why this model is preferable.

### Problem 8: Least-Squares Regression Equation for Chosen Model (2 points)

Write the least-squares regression equation for the model that best satisfies the assumptions, defining each term.

- **Guiding Questions**: For your chosen model, what are the predictors (`residences`, `size`, `structure`, `access`)? What does each term in the equation represent?

$$
\log(\text{Catch}) = -6.356 + 0.672 \cdot \log(\text{Residences}) + 0.220 \cdot \log(\text{Size}) + 1.111 \cdot \log(\text{Structure}) + 0.275 \cdot \text{Access}
$$

Here’s a breakdown of the equation components:

- **Intercept**: $-6.356$
- **Effect of log(Residences)**: $0.672$
- **Effect of log(Size)**: $0.220$
- **Effect of log(Structure)**: $1.111$
- **Effect of Access**: $0.275$

This model indicates that each predictor has a multiplicative effect on the catch when transformed logarithmically, with `Structure` and `Access` showing the most substantial contributions to `Catch` in this log-transformed model.

### Problem 9: Predicting Seasonal Bass Catch (2 points)

Use your final model to predict the seasonal bass catch for a lake with:
- 1.25 square miles in size
- 70 lakeshore residences per square mile
- Structure index of 45
- Public access (represented by `1`)

#### Code Example

```{webr-r}
# Model from model selection
finalModel <- lm(formula = logCatch ~ logResidences + logSize + logStructure + access, data = fishData)
summary(finalModel)

# Define new data point with transformed predictors
newLake <- data.frame(
  logResidences = log(70),
  logSize = log(1.25),
  logStructure = log(45),
  access = 1
)

# Predict using the chosen model
predictedLogCatch <- predict(finalModel, newdata = newLake)

# Convert the log prediction back to the original scale if needed
predictedCatch <- exp(predictedLogCatch)
predictedCatch

```

- **Guiding Questions**: Interpret the prediction in the context of the model. If a log transformation was used, remember to back-transform the predicted value.

### Problem 10: Interpreting the Coefficient of `access` (2 points)

Interpret the coefficient of `access` in your final model, explaining its impact on predicted seasonal bass catch.

- **Guiding Questions**: How does public access (1 vs. 0) affect predicted bass catch? What does the sign of the `access` coefficient indicate about lakes with public access compared to those without?
