# Objective

In this lab assignment, you will perform multiple regression analysis and model selection using the `bodyfat` dataset. You will explore the relationships between various explanatory variables and the response variable (percent body fat), assess regression assumptions, conduct hypothesis tests, and apply model selection techniques to build an optimal predictive model.

# Data Description

The `bodyfat` dataset contains the following variables:

- `fat`: Percent body fat
- `age`: Age in years
- `weight`: Weight in pounds
- `height`: Height in inches
- `chest`: Chest circumference in centimeters

# Problem 1: Identifying Highly Correlated Explanatory Variables

Based on both the scatterplot matrix of the explanatory variables and the correlation matrix, which two explanatory variables are “highly correlated”? Explain. You must use and refer to both the scatterplot matrix and the correlation matrix in your explanation of why these two variables are considered highly correlated. (Include the scatterplot matrix here. You do not have to include the correlation matrix.)

```{webr-r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(GGally)

# Read the bodyfat data
bodyfatData <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcervantesalvarez/MS-Statistics/main/Academic-Year-2024-2025/Fall%202024/ST-352-Labs/Lab4/bodyfat.txt", header = TRUE)

# Select explanatory variables (age, weight, height, chest)
explanatoryVars <- bodyfatData %>% select(age, weight, height, chest)

# Create scatterplot matrix
ggpairs(explanatoryVars,
        title = "Scatterplot Matrix of Explanatory Variables",
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 3)),
        lower = list(continuous = "points"),
        diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag"))
```


# Problem 2: Variable Selection Based on Correlation

In the Lab 4 Notes, a strategy was shown to help with deciding which highly correlated explanatory variable to remove. From that strategy, which of the two highly correlated explanatory variables mentioned in the lab notes would be removed? Explain why that variable would be removed.

Based on the strategy outlined in the Lab 4 Notes, the variable `height` would be removed. This decision is made because `weight` has a stronger theoretical or practical relevance to the response variable (`fat`) compared to `height`. Additionally, removing `height` helps to reduce multicollinearity in the model while retaining the explanatory variable that provides more meaningful information for prediction.

# Problem 3: Assessing Regression Assumptions

Include the graphical displays to assess the linearity, constant variation, and normality conditions (scatterplot matrix that includes the response variable, residual plot, and normal probability plot of the residuals).

```{webr-r}
# Select response and remaining explanatory variables after removing height
responseVar <- bodyfatData$fat
selectedExplanatory <- bodyfatData %>% select(age, weight, chest)

# Fit the initial multiple regression model
initialModel <- lm(fat ~ age + weight + chest, data = bodyfatData)
summary(initialModel)

# Scatterplot matrix including the response variable
ggpairs(data = bodyfatData %>% select(fat, age, weight, chest),
        title = "Scatterplot Matrix Including Response Variable",
        upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 3)),
        lower = list(continuous = "points"),
        diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag"))

# Residual plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # Arrange plots side by side
plot(initialModel$fitted.values, initialModel$residuals,
     main = "Residuals vs Fitted Values",
     xlab = "Fitted Values (Percent Body Fat)",
     ylab = "Residuals",
     pch = 19, col = "blue")
abline(h = 0, col = "red", lwd = 2)

# Normal probability plot of residuals
qqnorm(initialModel$residuals,
       main = "Normal Q-Q Plot of Residuals",
       pch = 19, col = "blue")
qqline(initialModel$residuals, col = "red", lwd = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1,1))  # Reset plotting layout
```

# Problem 4: Assessing Linearity

Using the appropriate graph, discuss whether or not the linearity condition is satisfied. Make sure to reference which plot you are using to assess this condition.





# Problem 5: Assessing Constant Variation

Using the appropriate graph, discuss whether or not the constant variation condition is satisfied. Make sure to reference which plot you are using to assess this condition.





# Problem 6: Assessing Normality

Using the appropriate graph, discuss whether or not the normality condition is satisfied. Make sure to reference which plot you are using to assess this condition.





# Problem 7: F-test for Overall Significance

Perform an F-test to determine if at least one explanatory variable is helpful in predicting the response.

### a.

State the null and alternative hypotheses in words.

- **Null Hypothesis** $H_0$: None of the explanatory variables (`age`, `weight`, `chest`) are associated with the response variable (`fat`). In other words, all regression coefficients are equal to zero. 

All $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$

- **Alternative Hypothesis** $H_a$: At least one of the explanatory variables (`age`, `weight`, `chest`) is associated with the response variable (`fat`). In other words, at least one regression coefficient is not equal to zero.

At least one $\beta_1,\beta_2,\beta_3 \ne 0$

### b. 

Using the regression output, report the F-statistic with degrees of freedom and the p-value. (No calculations are necessary! Include the regression output from R – please put the output below your answer to this question.)

```{webr-r}
# Perform the F-test by summarizing the initial model
summary(initialModel)
```

### c. 

State a conclusion from the F-test in the context of the problem. 


# Problem 8: T-tests for Individual Explanatory Variables

For each explanatory variable,

### a. 

Report the t-statistic with degrees of freedom and the p-value for the t-test (testing if that explanatory variable explains the response variable after accounting for the effects of the other variables).

```{webr-r}
# Extract summary of the initial model
modelSummary <- summary(initialModel)

# Extract coefficients
coefficients <- modelSummary$coefficients

# Create a table of t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and p-values
t_table <- data.frame(
  Variable = rownames(coefficients),
  `t-Statistic` = coefficients[, "t value"],
  `Degrees of Freedom` = modelSummary$df[2],
  `p-Value` = coefficients[, "Pr(>|t|)"]
)

# Display the table
print(t_table)
```

### b. 

State a conclusion in the context of the problem based on the p-value from the t-test. (You should have three separate sentences, one for the conclusion for each explanatory variable. Much of each sentence may contain the same wording, but you still need to write three separate sentences with three separate conclusions.)





# Problem 9: Backwards Selection Process


Suppose a backwards selection process was performed. Would any of the explanatory variables drop out? Why or why not? If so, which one would drop out first? Why?


# Problem 10: Final Model After Backwards Selection

If needed, perform a backwards selection process to obtain a model with only significant explanatory variables. Use the model with only significant explanatory variables to answer these questions:


```{webr-r}
# Perform backwards selection using stepAIC from MASS package
library(MASS)

# Initial model
initialModel <- lm(fat ~ age + weight + chest, data = bodyfatData)

# Perform backwards selection
backwardModel <- stepAIC(initialModel, direction = "backward", trace = FALSE)
```

### a. 

Include the regression output of your final model.

```{webr-r}
# Summary of the final model after backward selection
summary(backwardModel)
```


### b.

Write the least-squares regression equation. Define the terms in the equation (i.e., what the x’s and $\hat{y}$ represent in the context of the problem).

The least-squares regression equation outline:

$$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{age} + \beta_3 \times \text{weight} + \beta_4 \times \text{chest}
$$

Where:

- $\hat{y}$ is the predicted percent body fat.
- **age** is the age of the individual in years.
- **weight** is the weight of the individual in pounds.
- **chest** is the chest circumference in centimeters.

### c. 

Interpret the coefficient of Age in the context of the problem.





### d. 

Predict percent body fat for a 23-year-old who is 73 inches tall, and has a chest circumference of 120 cm. Use R to find this predicted value.

```{webr-r}
# Define the new data point
# Note: Since 'height' was removed from the model, it is not included in the prediction
newData <- data.frame(
  age = 23,
  weight = 180,    # Assuming weight in pounds
  chest = 120      # Chest circumference in centimeters
)

# Predict percent body fat
predictedBodyFat <- predict(backwardModel, newdata = newData)
predictedBodyFat
```


### e.

Report and interpret a 95% prediction interval for the person in question 10d.



```{webr-r}
# Calculate the 95% prediction interval
predictionInterval <- predict(backwardModel, newdata = newData, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)
predictionInterval
```

**95% Prediction Interval:**


# Conclusion

In this lab assignment, you successfully conducted multiple regression analysis on the `bodyfat` dataset. You identified highly correlated explanatory variables, assessed regression assumptions through various graphical displays, performed hypothesis tests to evaluate the significance of the model and individual predictors, and applied backwards selection to refine your model. The final model provides a robust framework for predicting body fat percentage based on selected physical measurements.
